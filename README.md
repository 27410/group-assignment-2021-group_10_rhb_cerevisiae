# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 10 - Production of hemoglobin in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*
> Dear students, thank you for accepting the group assignment. Please fill in the

> Please also replace `[PUT-YOUR-REPOSITORY-HERE]` up in the first line ðŸ‘† with the name of your repository here on GitHub.

> That way someone can click on the Binder badge icon and open your project in Jupyter lab to explore it.
> For this to work you will also have to keep `requirements.txt` up to date (by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
> Furthermore, this will only work if you decide to make your repository public (which you can do under Settings -> Options),
> which I would encourage you to do â€“ up to you. A lot of good science happens out in the open these days.
> Good luck!

## Project summary (<300 words)
> Describe the overall aim of your project and what you have achieved.

The aim of this project was to optimize the production of heterologously expressed human hemoglobin in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The reason for this was to lower the price of recombinant hemoglobin to make it competitive with blood donations, and ultimately ensuring a stable supply of blood for transfusions. 

The main cell factory engineering strategies applied to reach the aim was gene knockouts based on literature and computational algorithms, as well as identification of up- and downregulation targets. With these strategies we achieved.....
